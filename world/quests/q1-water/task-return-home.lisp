;; REMARK: I don't like the examination part. I don't think it's reasonable to assume that Catherine
;;         would know how to scan through those logs, given that she didn't even grow up before the calamity,
;;         and there's very little if any information on them out there, let alone how to maintain them.
;;         I think it would be much more reasonable if Catherine starts looking around for a way to interface
;;         with her, perhaps referencing something like "If we had a functioning computer maybe we could
;;         connect to her through some kinda data port..." but then fails to even find such a port.
;;         
;;         As for how she reactivated the stranger, I think something simple like applying pressure on her
;;         earlobe would work, rather than requiring any deep interfacing, and the way she discovered that
;;         was mostly dumb luck and curiosity, more than anything.
;; TIM REPLY - good points, adapted as directed

~ catherine
| Hey, Stranger - see, what'd I tell you?
| Jack here didn't think you'd come back.
~ jack
| This don't prove a thing.
~ fi
| You've done well, Catherine. An android is a great asset for us.
| Assuming it can be trusted.
~ catherine
| I don't understand...
~ fi
| Is it not coincidental that you discovered it at the same time our water supply was sabotaged?
~ catherine
| But we saw the rogues - they were dismantling the pump!
~ jack
| Maybe this android can control them? Did you think of that?
~ catherine
| ...
| Androids did used to have FFCS - er, far-field comms system.
| I guess something like that could penetrate deeper underground than our radios.
| But no, it's not that. She was offline for decades - there's no way she could have done that.
| And since I brought her online, she's been with me the whole time! She can't have done this.
~ jack
| But what do we really know about androids, Cathy? Fuck all, that's what.
~ catherine
| Well, ask her. Have you betrayed us, Stranger?
- No I have not.
  ~ catherine
  | There, see.
  ~ fi
  | Alright, well - let's hope it's telling the truth. If not, then the Wraw know our location, and their hunting packs are already on their way.
- I don't think I have.
  ~ catherine
  | Her memories are all muddled from before I brought her online. She hasn't, trust me.
  ~ fi
  | Alright, well - let's hope that's true. If not, then the Wraw know our location, and their hunting packs are already on their way.
- I suppose I could have.
  ~ catherine
  | She doesn't know what she's saying - her memories are all screwed up till the point I brought her online.
  ~ fi
  | Alright - it's hardly conclusive, but for now we'd better hope Catherine's right.
  | If not, then the Wraw know our location, and their hunting packs are already on their way.
~ jack
| Jesus, Fi... you're just gonna take that at face value?
~ fi
| What choice do I have?
~ jack
| Examine the thing, find out for sure.
~ fi
| Catherine, don't androids have a black box? Could that show us if the... FFCS was it, was active lately?
~ catherine
| Well... I guess we'd need to find some kind of interface port.
| Oh, and we'd need a working computer, which we don't have.
| Anyway, even if we did, don't you think you should ask HER if taking her apart is okay?
~ fi
| You're right, Catherine. I'm sorry...
| ... Stranger, wasn't it?
~ jack
| ...
~ fi
| Would you permit Catherine to examine you, assuming we can source a computer?
~ player
- I'd rather she didn't.
  ~ fi
  | It's your choice, of course.
  ~ jack
  | Really? You're gonna let this thing call the shots?
  ~ fi
  | This \"thing\" is a person, Jack. And I expect you to treat her as such.
  | I trust Catherine's judgement. For now, Stranger is our guest.
- Sure, why not.
  ~ fi
  | Good. Jack, speak with Sahil when he arrives, see what he can do for us.
  ~ jack
  | If you insist.
- As long as I'm still online afterwards.
  ~ catherine
  | Don't worry, I wouldn't let them switch you off.
  ~ fi
  | That's settled then. Jack, speak with Sahil when he arrives, see what he can do for us.
  ~ jack
  | If you insist.
~ fi
| But irrespective of all this, I am certain that the Wraw are our attackers.
| Which means they're close to discovering our location one way or another.
| I must consider our next course of action.
~ catherine
| Well, if there's nothing else, I'll see you both later.
| Hey Stranger, wait here - I want to talk.
~ fi
| Sayonara Catherine, Stranger.
~ jack
| You take care, Cathy.

| Thank you. Catherine, if you could proceed.
~ catherine
| This won't hurt a bit.
~ player
| //Catherine takes my right forearm and opens up an access panel. A strange sensation - I can no longer feel my skin in that area.//
~ catherine
| Nope, just like I said: her log is clean.
| If those rogue's were remote-controlled, the signal didn't come from her.
~ jack
| You sure, Cathy?
~ catherine
| Positive.
~ fi
| I am satisfied, for now. Thank you Catherine, Stranger.

~ catherine
| Urgh, adults. I mean, technically I'm an adult, but not like those dinosaurs.
| Oh! I almost forgot: It's our way to gift something to those that help us out.
| Since those two aren't likely to be feeling generous anytime soon, I'll give you these parts.

| It's not much, but you can trade them for things you might want. Or you will once Sahil gets here.
| He's overdue, which is not like him at all. Maybe those rogues scared him off.
| Anyway, don't worry about them. They'll soon see what I see - a big friendly badass who can protect us.
| Well, I've got work to do. I think Fi might want a private word with you.
| Just something about the way she was looking at you.
| Knowing Jack he'll have something for you as well - if only a mouthful of abuse.
| You take it easy. Seeya later!

;; Catherine got the android online, so she must know the basics about them
;; also, don't want to have to go to the lab and do this, as too much travelling back and fourth (fetch quests) - and besides, player could run off

#| todo too much exposition too soon... This should be at the end of Act 1?...
| Indeed, allow me to formally welcome you to the Noka.
| We don't have much, but we hope you'll be comfortable here.
| Just please understand that times are hard, and
| And please bear with us - it will be more difficult for some of us than others to have an android around the camp.

;; TODO: Explain Wraw yet? Hold off for quest 2/3? Say they have androids for parts/slave labour? Use them as electronic power supplies?

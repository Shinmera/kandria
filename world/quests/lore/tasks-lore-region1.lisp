;; Lore tooltips that can be accessed throughout the entire game - this quest can never be completed; some interactions may alter based on world state conditions.
;; Though maybe we add an achievement for finding and interacting with all of these.
;; Could structure across multiple tasks per region? So when a new region is accessed, it activates a new task full of lore triggers for that region.

;; add lore triggers to on-activate - just sprinkle for now, until final level design (activate now, so player can explore freely initially, if they want - or encounter them later)
;; occasional branching within, based on world state

;; TODO: add more around entire region 1 as the level design and tilesets gets refined

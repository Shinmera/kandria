\section{Planning \& Budget}
We've outlined our current planning starting from January 2021 to the release in early 2023 in the following \hyperref[fig:schedule]{Gantt chart}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \begin{ganttchart}[

  \end{ganttchart}
  \label{fig:schedule}
\end{figure}

We expect this schedule to change once we get a clearer picture of the workload required to produce the full game during the horizontal slice production. The current vertical slice effort has been very useful to help us better estimate the amount of time involved in producing a full section of the game.

\subsection{Market Research and Projected Sales}
We are targeting the PC market with Steam as our primary release platform. According to our market research, the typical price is between 10-20\$, with sales of recently released similar titles ranging from hundreds of thousands, to millions of units sold. For example, the recent "Skul: The Hero Slayer" accrued an estimated 350 thousand sales, while "Katana Zero" sold well over a million copies.

The combination of platformer and hack and slash genres, with a focus on open-world exploration, appears to be a market niche that we can exploit. With a price tag of 20\$ and an estimated sales count of around 10k units, we expect revenue of around 106'000\$ after accounting for store front cut and taxes.

\subsection{Budget}
Based on the schedule, market research, and our current team composition, we've put together a \hyperref[tab:budget]{budget plan} for the production of the game.

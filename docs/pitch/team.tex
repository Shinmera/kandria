Nicolas developed the game as a solo dev up until the team expansion in October of 2020. Realising that in order to reach the quality he aimed for he would need help, he hired Tim and Fred as part-time freelancers onto the project. Together we fleshed out the world and completed the necessary features and assets to complete pre-production by December.

Now with the vertical slice nearing completion and the atmosphere and mood of the world well established, we are in the process of hiring a composer onto the team, to help truly bring Kandria to life.

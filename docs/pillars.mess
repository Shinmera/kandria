## Hook
//What sets the game apart from the competition? What does this game do differently? These are good foundations for marketing and an elevator pitch.//

//Kandria// is a hand-crafted, 2D action game, which combines the wall-climbing verticality and precision puzzle platforming of //Celeste//, with the tight hack and slash swordplay of //NieR:Automata//, all set within an epic, post-apocalyptic RPG story and world. Questions of artificial life and android ethics abound as you thread and fight your way through hostility, and a complex web of uncertain truths.

**Steam Blurb**
//The Steam page launch blurb from November 2020://

You are an android unearthed from the ruins of the past. Explore vast, open-world puzzle-platform levels, and hack and slash your way through challenging non-linear missions for the flawed survivors of humanity. Unlock the mysteries of the past - and your role in the future.

## Tone
- Arid, fallen world
- Broken technology
- Decay
- Gritty
- Epic
- Personal
- Complicated

## Target Audience
Fans of the above genres, games, and tones. Post-apocalyptic content in particular seems to be on the rise, with new movies in the //Mad Max// and //Blade Runner// franchises in recent years, not to mention “wasteland” games like //NieR// and //Kenshi// proving popular.

**Target PEGI rating: 16+**
//Even if only being distributed on Steam where PEGI is optional, it’s a useful content guide.//

PEGI 16
This rating is applied once the depiction of violence (or sexual activity) reaches a stage that looks the same as would be expected in real life. The use of bad language in games with a PEGI 16 rating can be more extreme, while games of chance, and the use of tobacco, alcohol or illegal drugs can also be present.
